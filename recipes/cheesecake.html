    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 cups cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zest and juice</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C).</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. Press this mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan to create the crust.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Add the granulated sugar and continue to beat until well combined.</li>
        <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next one.</li>
        <li>Stir in the vanilla extract, lemon zest, and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Gently fold in the sour cream and all-purpose flour until the mixture is smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the cream cheese mixture over the graham cracker crust in the springform pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly.</li>
        <li>Turn off the oven, crack the oven door open, and let the cheesecake cool for about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to set completely.</li>
        <li>Once chilled and set, remove the cheesecake from the springform pan, slice, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
