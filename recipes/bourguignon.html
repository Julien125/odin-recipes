        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>2 cups red wine (Burgundy wine recommended)</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 pound (450g) mushrooms, quartered</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large Dutch oven, cook the chopped bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove the bacon and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Season the beef chunks with salt and black pepper. Add olive oil to the Dutch oven and brown the beef in batches. Remove the beef and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onion, minced garlic, and sliced carrots to the Dutch oven. Sauté until the onions are translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for a minute.</li>
        <li>Return the beef and bacon to the pot. Pour in the red wine and beef broth. Add dried thyme and bay leaves. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 2 hours, or until the beef is tender.</li>
        <li>In a separate skillet, sauté the mushrooms in a little olive oil until they're browned and tender.</li>
        <li>Remove the bay leaves from the beef mixture and discard them.</li>
        <li>Combine flour and some of the cooking liquid from the Dutch oven to create a smooth paste. Stir it back into the pot to thicken the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the sautéed mushrooms to the pot and simmer for an additional 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve your delicious Beef Bourguignon hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley.</li>
